<h2>Find where to give feedback or complain about a GP surgery</h2>
<p>This service will help you find the right place to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>have your say on what your doctor’s surgery does well - or what it needs to improve</li>
  <li>make a formal complaint</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a very quick response to your feedback or complaint, it’s often easiest to to speak to the practice manager at your surgery.</p>

<p>Giving positive or negative should never affect the quality of care you receive. But if you’re worried about speaking to your surgery directly, or are unhappy with their response, we can put you in touch with somebody else who can help.</p>
