<h2>Review your GP surgery</h2>
<section class="section">
  <p>Use this service to tell other members of the public what your doctor’s surgery does well and what it needs to improve. </p>

  <p>Your review must be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>about a visit to your surgery in the last 2 years</li>
    <li>honest and respectful</li>
    <li>useful to other patients or staff at your surgery</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We check every review. You’ll need to give us an email address so we can tell you if your comments have been published. </p>

  <p>Leaving a review should never have a bad effect on your care or treatment. But if you prefer to remain anonymous, you don’t have to put your name on your review. </p>

  <p>If you’re under 16, you must ask a parent or guardian for permission to leave a review.</p>
