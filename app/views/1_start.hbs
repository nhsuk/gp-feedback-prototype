<h2>Find where to give feedback or complain about a GP surgery</h2>
<p>Use this service to find the right place to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>comment on what your doctor’s surgery does well - or what it needs to improve</li>
  <li>make a formal complaint</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s often a good idea to go direct to your surgery with your comments, positive or negative.</p>

<p>But if don’t want to speak to your surgery, or are unhappy with their response, we can put you in touch with another organisation that can help.</p>
