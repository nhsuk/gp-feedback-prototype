<h3>Why this is right for you</h3>

<p>NHS England commissions GP services. It accepts feedback on those services - positive or negative. It will pass your feedback to your GP surgery for you.</p>

<h3>What to expect</h3>

<p>Staff at NHS England will respond no matter how you contact them. You can also ask them for a response from staff at the surgery, if you want one.</p>

<p>It may take a while to process your feedback. So if you want a quicker response, it might be better to talk to the practice manager at your surgery instead.</p>
