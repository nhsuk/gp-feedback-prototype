However, my second time I made an appointment, I had to run there but no one told me I am supposed to check in. I am not from Scotland, I live in the completely different country and also struggle understanding accents. Even when I was calling and asked the receptionist for repeating what they said, the receptionist made it even less understandable. Simply, I felt that I am not important and stupid for them. When I was waiting there for an hour, I was told to call another day. When I tried to have another appointment, I was told that I ignored two appointments before (I do not know anything about the other appointment and I was not informed about that) so I cannot have an appointment. So with almost a month of suffering tonsilitis, the doctor called me that it is not urgent and I just have to wait until it comes away.]]></div></content><ratings xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/ratingsandcomments"><rating><questionText>Are you able to get through to the surgery by telephone?</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Are you able to get an appointment when you want one?</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Do the staff treat you with dignity and respect?</questionText><answerText>Sometimes</answerText><answerMetric value="3" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How likely are you to recommend this GP surgery to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?</questionText><answerText>Extremely unlikely</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Option" /></rating></ratings><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">1854013</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid><commentattribution xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">Visited in October 2017.

I would like to know what happened during this visit to our surgery and would appreciate it if you could contact me by email so I can look at this further for you. Typically when a GP says you need a blood test they ask a patient to speak to the receptionist about providing a blood test with either our nurse or phlebotomist. It is normally the responsibility of the patients to inform the reception team that this is needed. I think perhaps there may have been a communication error that resulted in you sitting in reception for so long. If you could please email me on sameer.butt@nhs.net I would be happy to look at this further to see what went wrong and how we can avoid this in the future. We could also explore other visits that you have found to be less than satisfactory. I look forward to hearing from you.]]></content><in-reply-to ref="1721090" type="xhtml" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/gppractices/2915/comments/1721090?apikey=bbccdd" postingid="1721090" postingorganisationid="0" xmlns="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0" /><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments"></postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid><commentattribution xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">Posted on 28 September 2017 using NHSChoices</commentattribution></entry><entry><id>1737686R</id><title type="text">The GP practice replied:</title><published>2017-09-28T14:11:21+01:00</published><updated>2017-09-28T14:11:21+01:00</updated><author><name>Blackfriars Medical Practice</name></author><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Organisation commented on" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/gppractices/2915?apikey=bbccdd" /><link rel="related" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="Learning disability health check" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/services/types/srv0492/cl88689?apikey=bbccdd" /><link rel="self" type="application/xhtml+xml" title="The GP practice replied:" length="1000" href="http://v1.syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/organisations/gppractices/2915/comments/1737686R?apikey=bbccdd" /><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Original comment on NHS Choices website" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Services/GP/ReviewsAndRatings/DefaultView.aspx?id=40565" /><link rel="report" type="text/html" title="Report this comment as offensive or unsuitable" length="1000" href="http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/comments.aspx?contentId=1737686&amp;AreaId=5&amp;type=t" /><category term="reply" label="Whether this is a comment, reply or deletion" scheme="commentType" /><content type="xhtml"><![CDATA[Hello.

My experience with nursing I would grade as average/okay, and reception staff are perfunctory. 

Dr.s  I find myself having to explain to them general conditions because they seem to be largely ignorant of them and just shrug their shoulders and defer, &quot;oh, a specialist would know more about that.&quot; I spend more time during my appointment educating doctors about their own job than I am being examined, and I&apos;ve only seen them twice!. When speaking about allergies, I had to educate one Dr about the peanut family and they did not know what a lupin was (a legume that is often tested for in allergies). Base knowledge of any Dr. should already know this.
I saw another Dr for the first time recently for a possible ASD diagnosis, and they kept questioning me, if I read about it on the internet and suddenly think I have something, implying its all in my head, then addressed my debilitating heat sensitivity/sensory overload that causes dyspraxia type symptoms as just anxiety. A doctor would never say this. Be careful of any Dr. that dismisses symptoms as &quot;anxiety&quot;.
 
I am a lot older than I look and sound in person, I know my voice sounds like a teenager&apos;s sometimes and have difficulty with trust issues and being taken seriously. I&apos;ve a MSc in mental health and is part of my special interests, which is part of the reason why I speak differently, not because I know &quot;a lot of words from Google out of health anxiety/OCD/Hypochondriasis,&quot; which is a possibility with some people

Opening up to a Dr you&apos;ve never met about possibly having a personality disorder is an extremely vulnerable situation and I spent 10 minutes trying to justify my appointment and having to educate the Dr. who would not admit they just didn&apos;t know anything about it and instead, made me feel like I was a hypochondriac instead of being humble and just admitting ignorance. The Dr used zero terminology nor gave me any questions that displayed they had some base knowledge of ASD where they had the authority to treat me like that or dismiss what I&apos;m saying. The Dr. feigned the entire appointment and then said I&apos;d get a referral letter. Its been over two weeks and I still haven&apos;t recieved it. 

I&apos;d advise that doctors keep going on continual training to keep their knowledge up to date as their base knowledge appears questionable.

Appallingly long waits to get to speak to the receptionist - if indeed you get to speak to anyone at all.   This happens always.

2. Unacceptable and ridiculous waits for first available appointments.    Typically 7 to 10 days (by which time a condition could be much worse)
 The usual excuse is &amp;quot;so much pressure and demand on the health service&amp;quot;.  Well that doesn&apos;t help us the patients does it ?     Employ more G.Ps!!     I can recall back in the 80&apos;s I could see my G.P typically either the next day or the day after that.

&amp;quot;Telephone triage&amp;quot; - How long does that take?  10 minutes?  About the average time spent in the G.P&apos;s surgery anyway.

Having turned up on time for an appointment I have often spent 20 to 30 minutes waiting in reception.   A bit long, but the biggest annoyances are  1. getting to speak to the receptionist on the telephone and  2. The unacceptably long waits for appointments.

The reception staff leave a lot to be desired. They are unorganised, forgetful and chaotic which is a major let down to this surgery. Appointments always start between 15-30 minutes after schedule and it is difficult to get an appointment in the first place without waiting 2 weeks.
 I recently had an appointment which started 20 minutes late and was finished pretty quickly but needed to get a bloods test so sat back in reception. Either the GP failed to relay this to the nurse or reception did, but I was sat for another 15 minutes the asked the receptionist when I should expect to be seen - they didn&apos;t know I was waiting for the nurse then went to go and speak to her. 15 minutes later I ask again, &quot;when am I going to be seen?&quot; They had forgotten to ask the nurse the first time and went back into the room. I was then seen a few minutes later however this turned what could have been a 10 minute appointment if it had started on time to an hour and 10 minutes which is a joke. Other people were waiting around reception and sighing at the reception staff&apos;s incompetence. They manage to make a very simple job a complete mess. This is not the first bad experience I&apos;ve had here by far. They also appear rude when talking on the phone at times and have been unhelpful to me when calling up asking for results before.

We try our best to improve our service. I appreciate if you could email me your name and DOB at my email sameer.butt@nhs.net . I will investigate this matter and will write to you.

All lab reports are texted to patient&apos;s within 24 hours. If you do not receive any text message I would be very happy to investigate this matter as we have systems in place where we could check when message were delivered. All text message clearly say what lab report is about rather general comments like all your results are normal or abnormal. If you could let me know the name of reception staff I could investigate staff rudeness . We have option to record telephone calls but practice is in process of recording all telephone calls so we could improve our service.

I would like to remind that phone could be very busy at times. There are number of ways you could book appointment without ringing practice by using online services on our practice web site, i.e interactive services. Your could leave us a message there. You can also book online appointments by taking user name and password. For interactive services on our web site you do not need username or password.

I would appreciate if you could email me as that would be fair for practice to see what went wrong and how we could improve.

After suffering with chronic pain for the last 6 months, and repeated trips to the surgery, little help or support has been provided for my ongoing undiagnosed condition. I&apos;m often asked if I have tried paracetamol... I&apos;ve been in agony for 6 months, I think if paracetamol worked I wouldn&apos;t be in this condition. I was prescribed one set of tablets that I felt uncomfortable taking due to suffering with depression. I voiced this to one doctor, who was sympathetic and understood my concern and prescribed me a different set. The doctor required I booked a follow up appointment in a weeks time with them which I did at reception. Upon arriving to this booked appointment I was given a different doctor. This doctor then said to me that If I refused to take the previous medication prescribed, the pain I was in &quot;couldn&apos;t be that bad&quot; and that I mustn&apos;t be to concerned about resolving it. The doctor then went on to tell me that unless I took the tablets previously discussed with the original doctor, who was not going to refer me or offer any alternative medication. I was horrified that the doctor had said this. 

On another occasion I had some blood tests, I didn&apos;t hear any news for 2 weeks so I contacted reception and they told me my blood tests had come back okay. I had already had a scan at hospital so I knew something was supposed to be coming up on this blood test. I rang the surgery the back the following day to ask the receptionist to please double check the blood test results as it didn&apos;t quite add up. The receptionist once again told me I was fine so I asked them to check the dates. The receptionist then revealed that the blood test in question wasn&apos;t even on the system, the receptionist was reading test results from a previous blood test. So they told me I was fine when no blood test results were there to read. Unless I called back to ask them to double check and then double check again I would still be under the impression that everything was fine. The receptionist contacted the lab and told me that they wasn&apos;t sure what had happened but that the lab would send the results by post. I still didn&apos;t hear anything the week after so I called again without any news. I then went to the surgery to ask in person at reception and the person said they were unsure as they couldn&apos;t really get through to the lab on the phone so they didn&apos;t know if the results were being sent. So the receptionist lied about having resolved the missing blood test results over the phone. I then had to have my blood test re done and wait a further two weeks for my results. 

The person on reception is extremely rude and unhelpful. In this profession, you expect some amount of care and people skills and the NHS is there to help people in need. This person is unnaprochable, unfriendly and rude. I feel I&apos;m inconveniencing their day by contacting the surgery. Getting through a phone call with them to get an appointment is like drawing blood from a stone.]]></div></content><ratings xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/ratingsandcomments"><rating><questionText>Are you able to get through to the surgery by telephone?</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Are you able to get an appointment when you want one?</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Do the staff treat you with dignity and respect?</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Does the surgery involve you in decisions about your care and treatment?</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How likely are you to recommend this GP surgery to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?</questionText><answerText>Extremely unlikely</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Option" /></rating><rating><questionText>This GP practice provides accurate and up to date information on services and opening hours</questionText><answerText>Never</answerText><answerMetric value="1" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating></ratings><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">1687121</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid><commentattribution xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">Visited in June 2017.

Over the past year I&apos;ve had a number of appointments and not once been seen on time, ranging from 10 to an amazing 45 minutes late.  They&apos;ve adopted a new phone system in recent months which regularly means you&apos;re left waiting an age for them to answer the phone, and occasionally no one answers at all.  To top it all, they&apos;ve lost my prescriptions three times now because they can&apos;t get the EPS to work and end up printing it out instead of sending it to the pharmacy and it sits on their reception for days while I repeatedly go back to the pharmacy to see if its arrived yet.

Please speak to practice manager and he will sort it out. If you could cc me in complaint so I could investigate what went wrong and listen to the staff as well. If you could emil me at bfarooq@nhs.net . I am very willing to see what results are outstanding as there is no out standing results that are performed in practice. Apologise about you phone wait time but practice is busy, practice telephone system tells you your call number in the queue . I can&apos;t understand why can&apos;t you get appointment as the practice waiting time is no more than 5-6 days for routine appointments. Even today we have seen 12 extra emergency patients via urgent telephone triage. If your problem is urgent please book urgent telephone call by pressing 1 as option. If any staff refused to offer urgent telephone triage please let us know as we have call recording system.

As a practice team we work very hard and I am disappointed that we did not meet your expectations . As a patient you have choice of changing your GP only if wish to do so but I am still very keen to know in depth what went wrong and where so we could improve our service. After investigation we would be without identifying any of your information put further detailed response here so readers know what practice has learnt and how we improved our service.

There are 3 reception staff answering phones all the time from 8-6:30pm. Practice is busy and that&apos;s why there is long wait at times. We are in process of introducing message system that tells you approximate waiting time and your number in the queue. We are going to start some early appointments from 8 am from 1st week in May. Unfortunately there are still 35-40 DNA( did not attend) appointments per week. If you need late appointments than please let reception staff know. We have employed Phlebotomist from 1 week in May to increase blood taking slots to 36 per week .Slots will be available from 8am.Will discuss this in our monthly practice meeting to find appropriate solution for people working.

Once again thank you for your feedback and you could feedback with your name as we will invite you to joint our PPG.
