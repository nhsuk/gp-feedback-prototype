The doctors and nurses are very helpful and informative and I feel at ease if I have to visit with a problem. 

I find the reception staff let the practice down. It is often very difficult to get an answer on the phone, and on occasion have found them abrupt, and when you arrive at the booth you will be waiting whilst they chat and will avoid eye contact with you. Perhaps this isn&apos;t all of the receptionist but it does make it frustrating when they are in essence the gateway to getting an appointment. 

I have had a few minor problems where I have waited well over half an hour after my appointment time to be seen (I have always been on time), however I believe this is other patients faults and not that of the medical staff.

On one occasion I did hear some staff discussing the state of a patients home very loudly on the corridor. They were talking to each other from a short distance and going into detail of the condition this person was living in and I found this very unprofessional and would have been mortified if that was a relative or friend of mine.]]></div></content><ratings xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/ratingsandcomments"><rating><questionText>Are you able to get through to the surgery by telephone?</questionText><answerText>Rarely</answerText><answerMetric value="2" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Are you able to get an appointment when you want one?</questionText><answerText>Usually</answerText><answerMetric value="4" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Do the staff treat you with dignity and respect?</questionText><answerText>Usually</answerText><answerMetric value="4" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>Does the surgery involve you in decisions about your care and treatment?</questionText><answerText>Usually</answerText><answerMetric value="4" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating><rating><questionText>How likely are you to recommend this GP surgery to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?</questionText><answerText>Likely</answerText><answerMetric value="4" type="Option" /></rating><rating><questionText>This GP practice provides accurate and up to date information on services and opening hours</questionText><answerText>Always</answerText><answerMetric value="5" type="Scale" minValue="1" maxValue="5" /></rating></ratings><postingid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">1727784</postingid><postingorganisationid xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">0</postingorganisationid><commentattribution xmlns="http://syndication.nhschoices.nhs.uk/schemas/comments">Visited in May 2017.

When I phone to make an appointment I am greeted by an extremely rude person at reception who berates me for not phoning between the 8.30am-8.31am narrow window when they actually bother to answer the phones. The rest of the time the phone just rings out until someone answers and immediately disconnects it. I recently made the mistake of assuming my Dr would be ok to sign a medical form for a job interview I had - they charged me £90 for the trouble and didnt bother completing the form (signing their name only) for two weeks. This resulted in my start date being delayed, and again when I phoned through to chase the form up I received bad attitude and rudeness for daring to ask very standard questions ie &quot;when can i pick my form up?&quot;. The staff here genuinely seem to believe they are godlike beings and act as if you are a lower form of life if you dare to take up their time or make them work for their salaries.
